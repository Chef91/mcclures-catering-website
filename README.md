# Mcclure's Chefs, Llc.

This is a catering company created by Chef Wesley Graham that was created to help personal chefs find clients without all the hassle other sites offer. Some of these sites are outdated and very confusing. McClure's Chefs is aiming to modernize how customers find private/personal chefs without all the un-necessary issues these other sites seem to offer.
